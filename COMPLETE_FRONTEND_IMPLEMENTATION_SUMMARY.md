  | 'workflows'
  | 'teams'
  | 'governance'
  | 'employees'      // NEW
  | 'marketplace'    // NEW
  | 'roi-dashboard'  // NEW
  | 'pricing'        // NEW
  | 'configurator';  // NEW
```

import { MarketplacePage } from './pages/MarketplacePage';
import { ROIDashboardPage } from './pages/ROIDashboardPage';
import { PricingPage } from './pages/PricingPage';
import { ConfiguratorPage } from './pages/ConfiguratorPage';
```

```typescript
case 'employees':
  return <EmployeesPage />;
case 'marketplace':
  return <MarketplacePage />;
case 'roi-dashboard':
  return <ROIDashboardPage />;
case 'pricing':
  return <PricingPage />;
case 'configurator':
  return <ConfiguratorPage />;
```

### Step 2: Update Sidebar.tsx
